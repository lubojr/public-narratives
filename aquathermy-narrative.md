# Water-Sourced Heat from Flowing Water Bodies (Aquathermy)

## Background

<p style="text-align: justify;"/> Flowing water bodies represent a largely untapped resource for the provision of renewable heat. Utilization is achieved through heat pumps that extract thermal energy from river water and elevate it to the required temperature level. The potential analysis focuses on large-scale applications designed to feed into existing or planned thermal energy networks.
<p style="text-align: justify;"/> The analysis does not include:

* Small-scale systems for individual buildings
* Waste heat from sewer systems
* Standing water bodies (lakes), due to insufficient data availability
* Combined heating and cooling applications
* Localized topographical or ecological constraints that impede development

## Methodology
The following sections provide only a condensed overview of the methodological concept. A comprehensive and fully detailed description of all methodological steps, assumptions, and data sources can be found in the full report.

### Fundamental Principle of Aquathermy

<p style="text-align: justify;"/> The usable energy is derived by diverting a partial volumetric flow of a watercourse and directing it through a heat exchanger to a heat pump. The heat pump extracts thermal energy from the water and raises it to a temperature level suitable for use in district and local heating networks (Figure 1).

### Technical Potential

<p style="text-align: justify;"/> The efficiency of a large-scale heat pump supplied by river water depends primarily on two parameters:

* <b> Heat source: </b> The river water temperatures.
* <b> Heat sink: </b>: The required network temperatures on the demand side.
<p style="text-align: justify;"/> The lower the source temperature and the higher the required network temperatures, the lower the resulting seasonal performance factor (SPF). A technical potential is only reported if the energy-weighted SPF is at least <b>2.5</b>.

<p style="text-align: justify;"/> From an operational standpoint, the prevention of ice crystal formation on the heat exchanger is critical. Below a source temperature of approximately 4–6°C, no further heat can be extracted. River-water heat pumps with an open water circuit are therefore suitable primarily for covering the base load, but not for meeting peak heating demand during winter.

<em><u><b>Systemic Constraints</b></u></em>

<p style="text-align: justify;"/> The maximum feasible coverage shares for river-water-sourced heat pumps are determined by the system-related and hydraulic limitations of real-world heating networks.

<p style="text-align: justify;"/> The upper coverage limits are based on the WEM 2023 heat demand scenario, as ambient heat from flowing water bodies is primarily utilized in district heating systems, which achieve a greater scale in this scenario compared to Transition 2023.

<em><u><b>Spatial Constraints</b></u></em>

<p style="text-align: justify;"/> Analogous to open-area solar thermal systems and waste heat recovery, the technical suitability of aquathermy installations is additionally restricted by spatial factors. Only those river segments located within an allowable routing distance from a potential district heating service area are considered. The maximum permissible distance is derived, based on modelling, from the minimum available monthly thermal output of the heat pump.

<em><u><b>Consideration of Existing Infrastructure Sites</b></u></em>

<p style="text-align: justify;"/> Existing hydropower plants and river-crossing structures were given particular attention in the site selection process for aquathermy installations, as they offer significant infrastructural advantages, including:

* improved prospects in permitting procedures,

* existing hydraulic infrastructure (e.g., screening systems, flood protection),

* potential use of waste heat from electricity generation.

<em><u><b>Assessment of Additional River Sections</b></u></em>

<p style="text-align: justify;"/> River sections without existing infrastructure were also evaluated. For each section, an assessment was carried out to determine whether a potential district heating service area lies within the permissible routing distance.
<p style="text-align: justify;"/> For very large district heating areas, spatial querying was performed at two-kilometre intervals along the watercourse. A district heating area may be supplied by one or multiple aquathermy installations, but only up to the technology-specific upper coverage limit (Table 1).
### Realizable Potential
<p style="text-align: justify;"/> For aquathermy, the realisable potential effectively coincides with the technical potential, as current market penetration is extremely low and no robust historical market data exist to calibrate an S-curve diffusion model. Realizability is further constrained by factors that could not be addressed within the scope of this study:

* <p style="text-align: justify;"/><b> Flood and debris risks: </b> Flowing water bodies are highly vulnerable to flood events, floating debris, blockages, and temporary pollution. For large open-water intakes, this often constitutes a technical exclusion criterion, as plant safety and flood protection may be compromised. Although existing river-crossing structures (particularly run-of-river hydropower plants with screening systems) may offer advantages, the municipality-level modelling did not differentiate between risk categories or structural quality.

* <p style="text-align: justify;"/> <b> Operational limitations due to low water temperatures: </b>Year-round usability is strongly temperature dependent. In this study, mean monthly temperatures were used, and a utilisation threshold of 5°C was applied, below which no heat extraction was assumed. This simplification affects the calculated annual operating hours and does not account for whether a real heating-generation portfolio could integrate such a system up to the stated coverage limits.

### Calculation of Levelized Cost of Heat
<p style="text-align: justify;"/> Reliable and uniformly scalable cost data for large river-water heat pumps are not available that would allow for a nationwide economic assessment for Austria. Economic viability depends strongly on:

* permitting procedures and water law requirements, 

* existing or absent infrastructure, 

* hydraulic and thermal boundary conditions, 

* system integration and network temperatures, 

* project scale and site characteristics.

<p style="text-align: justify;"/> For this reason, the modelling of an LCOH (Levelized Cost of Heat) was intentionally omitted. Only technical potentials under systemic and spatial constraints are reported.

## Results

<p style="text-align: justify;"/> At the national level, the technical potential of river-water-sourced heat pumps for feeding district heating networks amounts to up to <b>41 TWh/year in 2030</b> and <b>49 TWh/year in 2040</b>.

##### Assessment of the Results

<p style="text-align: justify;"/> The analysis shows that flowing water bodies in Austria offer a relevant, though site-specific, potential for the provision of renewable heat. With technical heat-supply potentials of river-water-sourced large heat pumps of 4.4–6.4 TWh per year by 2030 and 5.3–7.6 TWh per year by 2040, aquathermy can contribute to decarbonisation particularly along major rivers such as the Danube, Inn, Enns, Drau, or Mur and in close proximity to existing or planned district heating networks.

##### Estimation of the Realisable Potential (Expert Judgement)

<p style="text-align: justify;"/> Although no explicit model for determining realisable potentials was applied in this study, the technical results and the identified constraints allow for a reasoned estimation of the likely scale.
<p style="text-align: justify;"/> In practice, the technical potentials are considerably limited by a range of site-specific and system-related factors. These include the strong spatial dependency on rivers and suitable district heating networks, restricted seasonal usability due to low winter water temperatures, and the high vulnerability of open intake systems to flooding, debris, and sediment loads. Additional limiting factors comprise water-law requirements, infrastructural prerequisites, and the limited market experience with large-scale aquathermy installations.
<p style="text-align: justify;"/> Taking these factors into account, it is expected that only a limited share of the technically suitable sites can actually be developed. Based on expert assessments, it is assumed that approximately 10–20% of the identified technical heat potentials may be realisable by 2030, and around 20–30% by 2040. This corresponds to a magnitude of 0,4–1,3 TWh per year of realisable heat from river-water heat pumps by 2030, and 1.1–2.3 TWh per year by 2040.
